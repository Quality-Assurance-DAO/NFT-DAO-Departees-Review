I have my own proposal in Fund 4. It aligned with the goals of the NFT-DAO proposal in Fund 3. Rich reached out to me and asked if I wanted to collaborate on the frontend for this project, seeing that my fund 4 proposal deliverables would be fulfilled and the DAO would have a nice-looking frontend, I decided to collaborate with the DAO. It seemed like a win-win situation.

The reality of this collaboration suddenly changed when the DAO got offered an IDO worth approximately 5 million dollars. I quickly went from writing simple react components for the frontend to creating a fully functional marketplace with a fake smart contract system.

Members of the development team for the DAO asked for equity for the contribution to the marketplace, seeing that Rich Kopcho made an LLC for the DAO and was offered an IDO; this seemed like a good idea at the time. I knew the importance of what I was building and the potential it had within the realm of the crypto industry. We were told by Rich that we were expected to work for free. Upon hearing that in a meeting, I decided to leave and stop contributing to the DAO.

The code I have written is my own and was not pushed to the DAO repo, though other members have contribution access to it. The other developers said to push to a DAO repo with a minimum set of solutions such that the group can leave as a whole. After leaving, I was removed from the repositories containing my original code.

Rich told specific members of the DAO, who have contribution access, to steal my full code from my repo. Also, he secretly recorded a conversation of my personal overview of my code to the team so he can hire third-party developers to reverse engineer the fake smart contract system.

Mutual Knowledge was hired to review said code and potentially build the marketplace for the DAO. The review was paid in full. The marketplace may be built. The problem lay within the marketplace building scheme, specifically the smart contract system they will implement. Plutus is not on mainnet so any smart contract style backend will be a fake smart contract backend. I worry that MuKn will be using the information from an unauthorized recording and code from a repo I can not access to create the marketplace.
