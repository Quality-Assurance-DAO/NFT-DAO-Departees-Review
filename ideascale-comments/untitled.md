### Will the other contributors ever be paid for their work?

### Yes, thanks for the opportunity to explain our reasoning and timing, once all the funding is received.

Yes, thanks for the opportunity to explain our reasoning and timing, once all the funding is received.

As the Fund-3 proposal states: "These funds will be allocated to community members who join with us to make this vision happen and be disbursed with transparency in the spirit of the DAO methodology and input."

Our wallet address is public: addr1qyd2t7r0na47eq08fjfjh29alqxlmqmrml2ulexw3xdx5d8zaagj3n6myd2jwdsgsa9778hwyer3sa6r9y6dtmuux0nssxherd

1\) Not all the funds from Catalyst have been received so they simply aren't available to disburse.

2\) The project is not complete. Thus, it isn't possible to fairly disburse funds until we can measure all the contributions, and the governance team is still working on a fair assessment model as well.

3\) The community is entrusting us to use their money to deliver the expected Return on Intention. That doesn't mean just any work gets rewarded, it means the work done "to make this vision happen" as you pointed out.

Our Contract with the community is an opportunity to contribute to an open-source project as the proposal states:

"Community Member n+1, ….individuals who could potentially pool their expertise into an all-embracing open-source version to benefit the entire community rather than one project. Their expertise is multivariate in development, SPO, marketing, design, business, and more." —The proposal states it is "open-source" 10 times.

However, above and beyond open-source models that typically aren't paid gigs, we allocated and will disburse funds to those "who join with us to make this vision happen".

As far as our Contract with Mutual Knowledge, it is a paid contractor arrangement. And the best thing that has happened in development. They concluded:

"The failure to build Akkadia to any master plan is a critical flaw in the code. It resulted in significant wasted effort in the form of components that do not connect to each other, crucial functionality never being built, and left no easy way to integrate the code components that were built. For these reasons, we believe the most cost-effective option for NFT DAO is to design and build Akkadia from scratch."

Should we pay for those contributions?

Now we have professionals with a plan and are making rapid progress to recover lost time. Had we paid these contributors already, we would have wasted money, would that be fiscally responsible?

Once we complete the MVP of Fund-3 and we can assess fairly all "community members who join with us to make this vision happen", we will disburse the funds accordingly.

About You: This kbs account just joined Ideascale today and specifically targeted all our F4/5 proposals below with similar comments. It appears you are disgruntled and feel something is owed you. I hardly believe I will be able to find a comment from your alias on any other proposal. It seems you lack the courage, transparency, honesty and the integrity to reveal your true identity.

I believe our Catalyst community will see your attempt to discredit these proposals for exactly what it is. Even so, our door is open, and anyone can come and go as they please, feel free to DM me if you want to resolve your angst.

### Hey Rich, Thanks for your response here.

[nftdao](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/3071109-48088)  Hey Rich, Thanks for your response here. I don't think it's fair to frame KBS as someone lacking courage, transparency, honesty, and integrity. To me, they seem like someone who feels they were genuinely misled and exploited by NFT-DAO. It should be acknowledged and steps should be taken to ensure things like this become much less likely to happen in the future. 

After reviewing the original F3 proposal, I can understand where the confusion stems from. [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088) 

The use of funds section clearly outlines deliverables with dollar amounts attached: Community - $5,340 Governance - $19,893 Development - $23,732 Directly below this the proposal reads "These funds will be allocated to community members who join us to make this vision happen and be disbursed with transparency in the spirit of the DAO methodology and input." 

To me this implies that if you as a community member help realize the goals listed above, then you will be rewarded. On 4/21/21 NFT-DAO presented updates in Catalyst TH showing the progress we had made towards these deliverables: Community - 94% complete Governance - 91% complete Development - 69% complete In response to the progress we had made, Catalyst then released a corresponding percentage of our F3 funds. 

Much of this progress was realized on the backs of the NFT-DAO community. If NFT-DAO was able to receive an expedited release of funds from Catalyst, shouldn't they also be able to attribute which community members those funds should be disbursed as implied in the use of funds section? 

Lastly, In my mind, Fund3 wasn't about delivering a fully functioning marketplace MVP, it was simply meant to establish the foundation for a lasting and thriving organization with the ability to complete the MVP during the next funding rounds. I hope NFT-DAO can get back on track. Please distribute any value that you, Troy, and the rest of the team feel I created to both current and previous NFT-DAO contributors that were directly responsible for the completion of deliverables reported by NFT-DAO on 4/21/21
