Thank you TAK for getting the ball rollingüôè some words on the situation in general and then follows my report

First off I didn‚Äôt leave because of lack of compensation or reward \(or even the outlook of such\), but because of lack of transparency, honesty and a set of established and agreed upon \(mindful\) values within the core of NFTDAO.

Additionally it‚Äôs important to state I don‚Äôt feel that anyone in the core team is acting out of intentional malice, however some might - to some extent - be ignorant towards the impact their actions have on the balance of the future of the global economy, the planet and us as humans. My report

3 \[Problems\] caused departure and what I \[tried to fix\]

1. Communication

intransparent reporting between holons \(‚Äúsiloing‚Äù\) \[Problem\]; Voted for opening meetings, limit tools, apps \[tried to fix\]

Lead to high cost of information acquisition: long discord texts, multiple collaboration tools and message apps. The more people joined the discord the more chaotic it got. That was described as a feature not a bug. Might be true to a point, as Paracelsius said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the dose that makes the poison‚Äù. Towards the end and likely mixed with my experience, the silos felt more intentional than accidental. 2\) Structure

Using the term DAO as a marketing tool \[Problem\]; Setup basic DAO structure, docs and focus collective attention there \[tried to fix\]

The name NFTDAO would suggest a basic DAO structure or at least the tools to build one have been decided upfront and established at least with documentation and initial workflows. None of this was available but expected to be delivered by the governance holon as a deliverable for Fund3. I was shocked to find out, still was eager to deliver and shifted focus towards building those structures as well as drafting and researching a token engineering design document, of which a reputation building mechanism would have been integrated in a DID \(optionally anon\) that is interoperable with other DIDs. Stephen created the Contribution Survey document and proposed a \(for now\) manual process to track contributions asap. In order to at a later stage be able to allocate rewards from funding to the value a contributor generated. Supported with a team \(or organisation\) charter drafted in concert with the the holons, we advocated those two documents should form the initial basis on which to start working as a DAO and successively automate the processes. The endeavour failed because the core team at NFTDAO decided it is much more important to focus on a ticket sale \(that was never the scope of the initial proposal\) for a marketplace \(that was also not part of the proposal\); thus the forming of a common goal or consensus about the values or collective mindset of said autonomous organisation was tagged as secondary goal. This led to the next issue responsible for my departure. 3\) Occam\(.\)fi and the ‚Äúhackathon‚Äù

When word emerged about a possible partnership with Occam\(.\)fi I have never heard of them before. \(I was shifting my personal focus from DeFi to governance beginning of this year.\) Once I started my due diligence I was reminded of the ICO craze back in 2017, that I‚Äôve been part of with the aeternity blockchain core team \(I left in summer 2017 to work in Malta on the DLT legislation framework\). When I found Cardano back in October 2017 I was happy to have stumbled upon a community that shared very similar values \(to mine\) and took transparency & honesty to a new level. The more appalled I was when I found about the private VC sale Occam\(.\)fi did before the launch. Stephen, being the high-priest of documentation, conjured up a due diligence document on Occam\(.\)fi that aggregated in a timeline everything that has happened, including community feedback and responses. I reviewed the document and sources for almost 3 days and concluded Occam\(.\)fi raises all red flags for me to personally attach the bad actor label. I voiced my concerns and also stated I will stop all work immediately until Occam\(.\)fi situation is resolved or discussed in the open with all holons. In case NFTDAO would go ahead with any kind of partnership or cooperation I would leave NFTDAO. Shortly after, it was mentioned in some of the private discord holon channels that NFTDAO was accepted to and ‚Äúwon‚Äù the Occam\(.\)fi hackathon. This is not sth that PC funds, or I with contributions, should power, enable or encourage - on the contrary. There is a longer list of the events and thoughts on Occam\(.\)fi - contact me if you want to read them. Currently doing

I currently work on setting up the afore mentioned basic structures, documents and workflows for a new ‚ÄúDAO‚Äù like project. We use the term ACO \(autonomus creator organisation\) SecretDecks ¬∑ GitHub 7 - A kind of DAO from creative creators for creative creators. The ‚ÄúSoul‚Äù \(or brand\) of the ACO is ‚ÄúSecretDecks‚Äù 3.

It‚Äôs about self knowledge through reading the Tarot and we roughly sketched a small app ecosystem around that. Stephen and Tyler are already knee deep in the trenches and are contributing left and right! Once the onboarding \(discord and github\) is setup \(about 85% done\) and we have the basic docs and workflows prepared \(about 65% done\), as well as have a process for distributing funds, that is when we‚Äôll apply for catalyst funding. Closing statement

I don‚Äôt feel that anyone in the core team is acting out of intentional malice, however some might - to some extent - be ignorant towards the impact their actions have on the balance of the future of the global economy, the planet and us as humans. We have this incredible tool \(DLT\) in our hands now that we can deploy to create transparent supply chains, closed loop economies and true value societies that takes into account the balance of natural emerging systems \(like our planetary ecosystem\) and integrates them as a stakeholder in a capitalism that is nurturing not neutering. That can only be accomplished if we start acting honest towards our Selfs and others, now.

Hopefully this will serve as a learning experience for all parties and we can grow and prosper next to each other.

Stay mindful, healthy & happy
